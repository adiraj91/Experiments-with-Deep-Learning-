# Experiments-with-Deep-Learning

The set of projects contain the implementations of deep learning projects. The scripts start from  from Single Layer Perceptrons ( Basic Logistic Regression Model) and gradual implementation of the CNN and further. 

## Set of Libraries 

I'll add libraries and the frameworks used as I make changes and add further scripts for implementations. 
Logistic Regression Model uses. 

- numpy 
- pandas
- Opencv 
- matplotlib 

The implementation is done using basic Gradient Descent logic and concepts of Vectorization.

## Data

The dataset used for analysis can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
