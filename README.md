# Experiments-with-Deep-Learning

The set of projects contain the implementations of deep learning projects. The scripts start from  from Single Layer Perceptrons ( Basic Logistic Regression Model) and gradual implementation of the CNN and further. 

## Set of Libraries 

I'll add libraries and the frameworks used as I make changes and add further scripts for implementations. 
Logistic Regression Model uses. 

- numpy 
- pandas
- Opencv 
- matplotlib 

The implementation is done using basic Gradient Descent logic and concepts of Vectorization.

## Implementations 

- Using Single Layer Perceptron (or Logistic Regression) to classify image data. Sigmoid functions and Gradient Descent Implementation.
- Single Layer NN using Gradient Descent and tangent as activation function on the implementation. 
- Currently both models are under-performing with accuracy of 59% on prediction accuracy.


## Data

The dataset used for analysis can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
